# Why Rotor?

## The Privacy Problem in Blockchain

Blockchain technology has revolutionized how we think about trust, transparency, and decentralized systems. However, this transparency comes with a significant drawback: **complete lack of financial privacy**.

Every transaction on public blockchains like Stellar is visible to anyone:
- Transaction amounts
- Sender addresses
- Recipient addresses
- Transaction timing and patterns
- Account balances

This creates several real-world problems:

### For Individuals

- **Financial Surveillance**: Anyone can track your entire transaction history and net worth
- **Personal Safety**: Publicly visible wealth can make you a target
- **Discrimination**: Financial institutions or services may treat you differently based on your transaction history
- **Loss of Autonomy**: Your spending habits, income, and financial relationships are exposed

### For Businesses

- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Competitors can analyze your payments, suppliers, and customer base
- **Price Discrimination**: Vendors may adjust pricing based on visible financial status
- **Trade Secrets**: Business relationships and deal structures become public knowledge
- **Employee Privacy**: Payroll and compensation become traceable

### For the Ecosystem

- **Reduced Adoption**: Privacy concerns prevent mainstream users from adopting blockchain payments
- **Regulatory Challenges**: Lack of confidential transactions limits enterprise adoption
- **Fungibility Issues**: Coins with certain transaction histories may be valued differently

## Why Stellar Needs Privacy

Stellar is designed for fast, low-cost payments and has excellent adoption for cross-border transactions and asset tokenization. However, like most blockchains, it lacks native privacy features. This limits its potential for:

- Private remittances
- Confidential business payments
- Salary distributions
- Personal financial management
- Anonymous donations

## The Rotor Solution

Rotor brings **programmable privacy** to Stellar without compromising security or decentralization:

### Non-Custodial
You maintain full control of your assets throughout the process. Rotor cannot access or freeze your funds.

### Zero-Knowledge Privacy
Using cutting-edge cryptography, Rotor proves transaction validity without revealing sensitive information. The blockchain verifies correctness without seeing the details.

### Regulatory Friendly
Unlike mixing services, Rotor enables legitimate privacy use cases with cryptographic guarantees and optional compliance features.

### Stellar-Native
Built on Soroban smart contracts, Rotor leverages Stellar's speed, low fees, and existing ecosystem while adding privacy as a layer.

### Open and Transparent
The protocol is fully open-source, auditable, and community-governed. Privacy through mathematics, not obscurity.

## Who Should Use Rotor?

### Privacy-Conscious Individuals
Anyone who values financial privacy and doesn't want their entire transaction history public.

### Businesses
Companies that need to keep supplier relationships, pricing, and business dealings confidential.

### DAOs and Organizations
Groups that want to maintain treasury privacy or distribute funds privately.

### Developers
Builders who want to integrate privacy features into their Stellar applications.

### Human Rights Activists
Those working in environments where financial surveillance poses real risks.

## The Path Forward

Privacy is not about hiding illegal activity—it's about protecting fundamental rights. Just as you wouldn't want all your emails, messages, and phone calls to be public, your financial transactions deserve the same level of privacy.

Rotor makes this possible on Stellar, bringing blockchain technology one step closer to mainstream adoption while preserving the decentralization and security that makes it valuable.
